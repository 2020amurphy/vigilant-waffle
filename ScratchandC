What is a double equal sign in C? Example: ( x == y ) 
  The double equal signs is a check and returns a true or false if the two variable hold the same value 
Why do you need the keyword true in order to create a forever loop? 
  Everytime the boolean is executed it always treurns true therefore the loop will run forever
What are the three inputs required to use a for loop (be able to verbally communicate/explain these three inputs)
  o write a loop that runs a specific number of times, we use the for keyword, and first, 
  we create a variable named i and set it to 0. 
  i is a conventional name for a variable that keeps track of how many iterations of the loop weâ€™ve already done. 
  Then, we check that i < 50 every time we reach the top of the loop, before we run any of the code inside. 
  If that expression is true, then we run the code inside. 
  Finally, after we run the code inside, we use i++ to add one to i, and the loop repeats.
What does a % mean in the printf function? 
  % is a placeholder or different elements such as strings, ints, or floats that will be aded later.
